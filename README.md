# my-3d-engine
This is a personal project I am working on to create a 3D engine completely from scratch that displays in the terminal. I am using the following tutorial: https://youtu.be/ih20l3pJoeU

## TODO list
- ~~Triangle projection~~
- ~~Normals & culling~~
- ~~Basic Lighting~~
- ~~Object files~~
- Polygon sorting
- Cameras
- Clipping
- Texture
- Perspective Correction
- Depth buffer

## Added features:
- Control the viewport with WASD (not the camera but rather the translations of objects in space)
- Display multiple objects at the same time.
- Uses Python for high-level stuff (controls, call the 3D engine every frame, etc).

## Usage:
`python3 high_level.py`
Automatically compiles the C files and runs the project.
